LOCAL COORDINATES

worldspace coordinates work as is?
when the player moves, update all local coordinates

OR
superimpose a grid thats different? 

.5
|     /
|    /
|   /
|30/  1
| /
|/



maybe load an environment htats bigger than the player view, like the six chunks around it,
so you can just scroll through them, and just buffer more and unload others when you 
officially enter one of the new neighboring chunks




MAKE "HEX" COMPARABLE BY DISTANCE SO YOU CAN USE MORE EFFICIENT SEARCH ALGORITHMS




fort actions:
recruit crew
attack
trade





for land, just path to their closest water neighbor



make generic "action" class that moving and attacking and interacting inherit
from so you can queue them all
